# CHANGELOG

#### v4.0.0-alpha.14

- Component was fully reworked with power of TypeScript;
- Inner kitchen was optimised and now it is 1.5-2 times faster;
- A lot of API and semantics and classnames changes - better to treat it as a whole new component;

#### v4.0.0-alpha.15

- Due to some issues with content size translation and paddings added extra wrapper element;
- Little API changes;
- Classnames changes;

> **NOTE**  
> Feel sorry fo breaking capability for the third time during the v4-alpha stage but i have to do it to name things properly.  
> Earlier some things been named not obvious and there was a little mess with classnames.  
> From now i can surely say that basic elements classnames are locked and API will be developed with maximum backward capability.  
> Sorry for any inconvenience. 🙏
